# Fitness Planet 

## Introduction:  
Hello to the person sitting at the other end! ðŸ‘‹  

We decided to create this project (website) not necessarily as an out-of-the-box idea, but rather to take this opportunity to hone our skills in web development and explore further possibilities. This project serves as a learning experience while also being a functional and well-designed website.  

## Features:  
- **Modern UI** â€“ Clean and user-friendly interface.  
- **Dynamic Content** â€“ Interactive elements to enhance user experience.  

## Technologies Used:  
- **HTML** â€“ Structuring the website.  
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Adding interactivity.  

## To enable the chatbot:
- **Get a Gemini API Key** - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create a new key.
- **Create .env file** - In the project's root, create a file named .env.
- **Add your key** - Inside .env, add GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY (replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY with your actual key).
- **Restart server** - If using a local server, restart it for changes to take effect.
